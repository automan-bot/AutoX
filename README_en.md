# Auto.js and AutoX.js
[中文文档](README.md)
## Introduction
A JavaScript runtime and development environment on the Android platform that supports accessibility services, 
and its development goals are similar to JsBox and Workflow.

 ~~Since the [original author](https://github.com/hyb1996) no longer maintains the Auto.js project,
 I plan to continue the maintainer project on the original basis. This project will be transferred 
 from [autojs](https://github.com/hyb1996/Auto.js) The project is named Autox.js. What you are looking 
 at is the project based on the original version 4.1. Later, I will introduce how to develop and 
 run the project itself. More developers are welcome to participate in the maintenance and upgrade 
 of this project. The latest [Autox.js Address](https://github.com/kkevsekk1/AutoX), many original project
 paths in the document, I do not intend to replace them if the original project is not deleted,
 to show respect for the original author. The encryption-related content in this document may 
 conflict with the actual operation. If you want to write code encrypted to protect intellectual 
 property rights, please refer to the project https:github.comkkevsekk1webpack-autojs I will gradually
 improve and update the program code, keep it as much as possible Consistent.~~

This project is obtained from [hyb1996](https://github.com/hyb1996/Auto.js) autojs and named as 
Autox.js (autojs modified version). What you are looking at now is the project based on the original
4.1 version. Later we will discuss how the project itself The development and operation are introduced,
and more developers are welcome to participate in the maintenance and upgrade of this project.

### Autox.js download address: 
[https://github.com/kkevsekk1/AutoX/releases](https://github.com/kkevsekk1/AutoX/releases)
#### APK version description：
- universal: Universal version (don't care about the size of the installation package, just use this version, including the following 2 CPU architectures so)
- armeabi-v7a: 32-bit ARM device (preferred for spare)
- arm64-v8a: 64-bit ARM device (mainstream flagship)

### Feature
1. Simple and easy-to-use automation functions implemented by accessibility services
2. Floating window recording and running
3. More professional & powerful selector API, providing search, traversal, information acquisition, operation, etc. on the controls on the screen. Similar to Google's UI testing framework UiAutomator, you can also use it as a mobile UI testing framework
4. Using JavaScript as the scripting language, and supporting functions such as code completion, variable renaming, code formatting, search and replacement, etc., it can be used as a JavaScript IDE
5. Supports the use of e 4 x to write the interface, and can package Java Script as apk file, you can use it to develop gadget applications
6. Supports the use of root privileges to provide more powerful screen tap, swipe, record and run shell commands. Recording and recording can generate js files or binary files, and the playback of recorded actions is relatively smooth
7. Provides functions such as taking screenshots, saving screenshots, finding colors in pictures, and finding pictures
8. Can be used as a Tasker plugin, combined with Tasker for daily workflow
9. With an interface analysis tool, similar to Android Studio's LayoutInspector, it can analyze the interface level and scope, and obtain the control information on the interface.


This software is different from software such as Button Wizard. The main differences are:
1. Autox.js is mainly aimed at automation and workflow, and is more convenient for daily work, such as automatically blocking notifications when starting a game, one-click WeChat video with a specific contact (this problem has occurred on Zhihu, and it is difficult for the elderly to perform complex tasks.) operation and children for WeChat video), etc.
2. Autox.js compatibility is better. Coordinate-based button sprites and script sprites are prone to resolution problems, while control-based Auto.js does not have this problem
3. Autox.js does not require root privileges to perform most tasks. Only related functions that require precise coordinates to click and slide require root privileges
4. Autox.js can provide functions such as interface writing, not only as a script software


### Autojs information
* Official Forums： [autojs.org](http://www.autojs.org)
* Docs：Online documentation is [here](https://hyb1996.github.io/AutoJs-Docs/). Documentation is still incomplete at the moment.
* Example：Some examples can be viewed [here](https://github.com/hyb1996/NoRootScriptDroid/tree/master/app/src/main/assets/sample), or viewed and run directly within the app.

#### Compilation related：
Command description: Run the command in the project root directory, if using Windows powerShell < 7.0, use the command containing ";"

##### Install the debug build locally to the device：
```shell
./gradlew app:buildDebugTemplateApp && ./gradlew app:assembleV6Debug && ./gradlew app:installV6Debug
#or
./gradlew app:buildDebugTemplateApp ; ./gradlew app:assembleV6Debug ; ./gradlew app:installV6Debug
```
The generated debug version APK file is under app/build/outputs/apk/v6/debug with the default signature

##### Compile the release version locally：
```shell
./gradlew app:buildTemplateApp && ./gradlew inrt:cp2APP && ./gradlew app:assembleV6
#or
./gradlew app:buildTemplateApp ; ./gradlew inrt:cp2APP ; ./gradlew app:assembleV6
```
The generated APK file is an unsigned APK file. Under app/build/outputs/apk/v6/release, it needs to be signed before it can be installed.

##### Local Android Studio to run the debug build to the device:
First run the following command:

```shell
./gradlew app:buildDebugTemplateApp
```

Then click the Android Studio Run button

##### Local Android Studio compiles and signs the release APK:
First run the following command:

```shell
./gradlew app:buildTemplateApp
```

Then click Android Studio menu "Build" -> "Generate Signed Bundle APK..." -> check "APK" 
-> "Next" -> select or create a new certificate -> "Next" -> select "v6Release" -> "Finish"
Generated APK file, under app/v6/release
